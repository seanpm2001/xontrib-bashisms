## Installation

To install use pip:

```bash
xpip install xontrib-bashisms
# or: xpip install -U git+https://github.com/xonsh/xontrib-bashisms
```

* `!!`, `!$`, `!^`, `!*`
* `alias`
* `export`

* `set`
* `shopt`
* `complete`
* `set <-e|+e|-x|+x>`

## Known issues

The `xontrib-bashisms` appeared in the beginning of xonsh history as part of the default xontribs. It has issues and we recommend to use [xontrib-sh](https://github.com/anki-code/xontrib-sh) instead.

### Threading issues

Because of xontrib-bashisms sets [`THREAD_SUBPROCS=False`](https://xon.sh/envvars.html#thread-subprocs) there are issues around the threading could appear.

### Only interactive mode

The xontrib features are implemented as [on_precommand events](https://xon.sh/events.html#on-precommand) and
these additions do not affect the xonsh language when run as script.
That said, you might find them useful if you have strong muscle memory in interactive mode.

## Debug

This xontrib may modify user command line input to implement its behavior.
To see the modifications as they are applied (in unified diffformat), please set [`$XONSH_DEBUG`](https://xon.sh/envvars.html#xonsh-debug) to `2` or higher.
