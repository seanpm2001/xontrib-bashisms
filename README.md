## Installation

To install use pip:

```bash
xpip install xontrib-bashisms
# or: xpip install -U git+https://github.com/xonsh/xontrib-bashisms
```

## Usage
```bash
xontrib load bashisms
```

Enables additional limited Bash-like syntax and commands while at the interactive command prompt:

| Added  | Meaning  | Xonsh alternative  |
|---|---|---|
| `!!`  | Repeat the last command.  | todo  |
| `!^`  | Get the first argument from the preceding command.  | todo  |
| `!$`  | Get the last argument from the preceding command.  | `__xonsh__.history[-1, -1]`  |
| `!*`  | Get all argument from the preceding command.  | todo  |
| `alias`  | Add alias.  | `aliases['ll'] = 'ls -la'`  |
| `export NAME=Peter`  | Setting an environment variable.  |  `$NAME = 'Peter'` |
| `shopt -s dotglob`  | Globbing files with * or ** will also match dotfiles, or those "hidden" files.  | `$DOTGLOB = True`  |
| `complete`  | Show list of completers.  | `completer list`  |
| `set <-e/+e>`  |  Cause a failure after a non-zero return code.  | `$RAISE_SUBPROC_ERROR = True`  |
| `set <-x/+x>` | Turns on tracing of source code lines during execution. | `trace on` and `$XONSH_TRACE_SUBPROC = True` |
| `unset NAME`  | Unsetting/deleting an environment variable.  | `del $NAME`  |

## Known issues

The `xontrib-bashisms` appeared in the beginning of xonsh history as part of the default xontribs. It has issues and we recommend to use [xontrib-sh](https://github.com/anki-code/xontrib-sh) instead.

### Threading issues

Because of xontrib-bashisms sets [`THREAD_SUBPROCS=False`](https://xon.sh/envvars.html#thread-subprocs) there are issues around the threading could appear. If you're using bashisms and faced with issues try the same in `xonsh --no-rc` mode before reporting the issue.

### Only interactive mode

The xontrib features are implemented as [on_precommand events](https://xon.sh/events.html#on-precommand) and
these additions do not affect the xonsh language when run as script.
That said, you might find them useful if you have strong muscle memory in interactive mode.

## Debug

This xontrib may modify user command line input to implement its behavior.
To see the modifications as they are applied (in unified diffformat), please set [`$XONSH_DEBUG`](https://xon.sh/envvars.html#xonsh-debug) to `2` or higher.
